# Software_metrics
My attempt to create a dashboard to list useful metrics from different software development tools.

Due to it looking likely I'll be back in a delivery role after a few months focussing on coaching, mentoring and the software practice, I think it would be super helpful to have a single dashboard (I'll be using Grafana for the dashboard, connected to mySQL) showing key metrics from dev tools such as Jira, Gitlab/hub, SonarQube, and possibly others.
Grafana, MySQL and, for the most part, Python are new to me. So I'll be learning as I go.
Aim to get a walking skeleton up within a week. If it looks helpful I plan to write it up on my website and possibly contianerise it for each setup.
